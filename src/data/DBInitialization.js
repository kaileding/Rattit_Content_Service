That’s why Google constantly has to throw massive resources at preventing it. That’s (one of the many reasons) why Google had to develop Chrome, to prevent the other browsers from blocking Google. That’s why Google had to go through the trouble of developing a major phone OS, Android, to prevent being shut out of that market. That’s why Google spends a lot of time with open standards committees, to prevent more proprietary solutions from gumming up the market. At any point, the Trump government could do great damage to Google, or any other company that appears ungrateful to him.\n\nSo, yeah, it’s a constant battle just to stay alive.",

They are heavily investing on startup’s and trying to build a start up ecosystem which will feed them with result in future. But, if we see the quantum of investment they lost in few of their major almost dead products, few still live like Google Plus and few more (Check the Google Graveyard) these affected a lot on income generation strength of many Google Products.\n\nDue to heavy pressure on google to deliver from its platform it need to spend monumental amount running its almost unthinkable infrastructure. Still for years it has delivered quite well and i would say they now rule in 3 segments, they are:\n\n1. Search\n2. Mobile\n3. Browser\n\n",
